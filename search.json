    "text": "Nintendo GameBoy Advance: “bit Generations: Coloris,” 2006. Sound design by Cornelius [Keigo Oyamada]\n\n\nRecent scholarship on contemporary electronic music genres, from electronic dance music (EDM) to micromusic, has suggested that the analysis of such musics needs to move beyond categories of musicological analysis that were developed in relation to classical and modernist musics – harmony, cadences, counterpoint, scale, serialism, and so on – since so much of what characterizes electronic music and its aesthetics simply does not make sense in terms of conventional categories of musicological analysis. Instead, scholars such as Joanna Demers and Mandy Suzanne-Wong have proposed an analytical methodology that draws on the acousmatic theory of Pierre Schaeffer and the Groupe de Recherches Musicales in the 1950s. Centered on what he called the objet sonore, or sound object, Schaeffer advocated a mode of listening that seeks to focus attention and analysis purely on the acoustic properties of a sound itself, irrespective of its source. This was the basis for his tape-manipulation experiments with Pierre Henry and others that would become known as musique concrète. Schaeffer went on to develop an elaborate taxonomy of such sounds and their timbres and textures, a project that has been the subject of renewed interest in recent decades thanks to the support of sound theorist Michel Chion.Joanna Demers, Listening Through The Noise: The Aesthetics of Experimental Electronic Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010).Mandy-Suzanne Wong, “Listening to EDM: Sound Object Analysis and Vital Materialism,” Volume!, 10 (1): 193-211.\nAnyone familiar with the music of Oyamada Keigo—better known under the name of his Planet of the Apes alter ego, Cornelius—is likely to point out that his stylistic range is hardly limited to electronic music, extending across the spectrum from speed metal to bossa nova; but I would like to suggest that his music provides a particularly interesting case study for what we might call a sound-object oriented approach, not least because it has itself been increasingly organized around the construction and interplay of interesting sound objects, whose often idiosyncratic sound envelopes are key components of his musical aesthetics, from a theremin to a Roland Space Echo delay.\n\n\n\nIn a guest entry for the Memories of Shibuya blog, a forum for nostalgic evocations of the Shibuya-kei style, Nick Currie (aka Momus) begins by describing 3D Corporation, the jimusho in Nakameguro where artists such as Cornelius and Kahimi Karie worked at the time:Momus [Nick Currie], “Artist Spotlight: Kahimi Karie (week two)” (Memories of Shibuya, 10 January 2015).\n\nThe top floor contained a tiny but funky recording studio crammed with Cornelius’s gadgets and trinkets: Moog synths, Maestro drum machines, guitars, a Mac, airbells, a minuscule padded live room. On one side there were views down to the cherry-lined Meguro River, on the other loomed the skyscrapers and flyovers of Shibuya. When Cornelius advertised his Point album with the slogan “From Nakameguro to everywhere,” this room was the “point” in question, the place where, day by day, the three-dimensional music got made. [My emphasis]\n\nThe description of Oyamada Keigo’s music as three-dimensional here is intriguing, but not just in terms of its relevance to his three albums as Cornelius up to Fantasma. The idea that I want to explore here, indeed, is that the concept of three-dimensional music provides a useful way of understanding the musical trajectory that Oyamada began with Fantasma, and that has continued up to the present in his most recent work. Looking back over the past two decades, as I will try to suggest here, the name of 3D Corporation seems eerily appropriate, even prophetic. But to understand this point, we need to begin with animation.\n\n\n\nAnimation is a key element in Oyamada’s audiovisual aesthetics. While composing his 1997 album Fantasma he visited Disneyland in Anaheim, and has said that the album was in part inspired by the “It’s A Small World” ride. Fantasma directly references Disney in several places—we could start with the similarities between Fantasma and Fantasia—but Disney is by no means the only form of animation referenced on the album: one of its most remarkable tracks is built around a sample of the theme music to a 1950s home stereo demo disk featuring the cartoon character Mr. Magoo; the same track includes a different sample of a late-1950s tune by the creator of the Chipmunks, the pitch-shifted rodents who pioneered the 1960s tape manipulation craze. Reviewers of Fantasma picked up on the album’s cartoonish quality, including its Roadrunner tempos, abrupt changes of direction, and collage aesthetics. In this respect, Fantasma has much in common with the 1930s compositions of bandleader and, later, electronic music pioneer Raymond Scott, later repurposed by Carl Stalling for Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes cartoons. In my book on Fantasma, I argue that the album in its entirety can be seen as a work of sonic animation, in which binaurally recorded sounds, from a popping soda can to a buzzing fly to cartoon soundtracks themselves, are animated in a stereophonic spectacular prefigured by Disney’s own historical landmark in surround sound, Fantasia. In many ways, I suggest, Fantasma can be seen as the musical counterpart of Tokyo Disneyland, a Japanese adaptation of the Magic Kingdom whose individual tracks are reminiscent of the spectacular vehicles of its famous Electrical Parade.\n\n\n\nIf Fantasma’s dazzling parade of samples and musical references continually remind us that it is a small world, after all, the album proved to be a pivotal moment in Oyamada’s musical career. With his next album, Point (2000), to the disappointment of some, his music began to move in a more abstract direction, a trajectory that would continue with the album that followed it, Sensuous (2006). The transition that begins with Fantasma first involves a move away from what I call a referential music based on sampling, collage, and stylistic pastiche, which also characterized Oyamada’s first two albums as Cornelius, towards a more minimalist, non-referential music as a world of animated sound objects—a “magic kingdom” all of its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should make it clear that I’m not using either the term “non-referential” or “sound object” in Pierre Schaeffer’s sense of the term. To describe the music on Fantasma as “referential” is to say that almost its every detail, including non-musical elements, are a quotation of some sort that invites us to try to identify what it points to. The most obvious form of such reference would be the sampling of historical sound sources, or stylistic pastiche, but it also includes non-musical elements such as most of the album’s song titles (“Star Fruits Surf Rider” to “God Only Knows”), and its psychedelia-inspired artwork. Indeed, the album becomes increasingly self-referential as it progresses, reiterating earlier motifs until its penultimate track, “Thank You For The Music,” which is more or less a medley of the album itself up to that point.\nWhat we also hear on Fantasma, however, are the beginnings of a new preoccupation with sounds not heard on the preceding albums but which comes to the fore in subsequent ones, with both musical and non-musical sounds, which became the basis for a distinctive sound library utilized on many of Oyamada’s subsequent projects. These sounds are non-referential, not in Schaeffer’s sense that the source itself remains unidentifiable, but that they are not referencing a particular musical source—the way, for example, the whistled motif at the beginning of the album references the opening of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, or the melody of “2010” references Bach’s Fugue in G Minor. In Oyamada’s soundworld, we may identify a sound as coming from a musical instrument, whether a guitar, an electric piano, or an autoharp, but the loop or hit in question exists independently of any specific musical referent. From Point onwards, these sound objects, and the animated interplay between them, become the building-blocks of Oyamada’s soundworld.\nThe constant running from Fantasma to Point and beyond is animation; but whereas animation in Fantasma is primarily another kind of reference (Fantasia, Mr. Magoo), from Point onwards the emphasis shifts towards animation as a musical practice. In the albums following Fantasma, Oyamada’s music becomes increasingly modular, often recalling the drifting structure of a mobile. What is interesting about Oyamada’s interest in animation is that it is not limited to musical objects but expands into the visual realm, and the creation of animated audiovisual works that explore the interplay between music and motion graphics, sound and visual objects.\nBoth Point and Sensuous were released not just on CD as albums in the traditional sense, but also on DVD as collections which are not simply “music videos” in the PMV sense of serving a promotional purpose secondary to the songs themselves, but audiovisual works in their own right, in which the music becomes a soundtrack synchronized with animated motion graphics. Oyamada’s longstanding collaboration with visual artist Tsujikawa Koichiro is thus not just a matter of producing music videos but the co-creation of a new kind of digital visual music in which musical and graphic animation become mutually metaphorical counterparts. In one video, for example, “Like a Rolling Stone,” (a reference to Bob Dylan’s famous song), a rolling, reverberating sound object reminiscent of musique concrète finds a visual counterpart in a pebble that metaphormoses into a complex landscape of animated circling toy figures.\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nTwo closely related elements of this new audiovisual aesthetic are sequencing and synchronization: the seamless timing of audio and video, musical and visual sequences, so that audiovisual space and the sonic and graphic objects that animate it are experienced as one and the same thing. This synchronization of visual narrative and musical soundtrack is one of the hallmarks of animation, originating in Walt Disney’s earliest sound cartoons of the late 1920s and perfected in Fantasia, in a technique that has become known as “Mickey Mousing.” This audiovisual synchronization is today a routine practice in the studio, of course, where multi-track sequencing has made it simply a matter of dragging audio and video clips around along parallel timelines; but reproducing it in a live performance presents a much more daunting challenge. Beginning with Point and continuing with Sensuous, however, Oyamada took up this challenge, with his band performing songs in perfect synchronization with Tsujikawa’s visuals. Such synchronized performances have remained the basis of Oyamada’s live shows up to the recent tours for his latest album, Mellow Waves. While the synchronization of music and image is certainly a tour de force in terms of performance, however, it does have certain limitations, not least in its exclusion of what is arguably one of the most pleasurable elements of live musical performance: its spontaneity and capacity for the unexpected, whether in the form of extended solos, improvisations, or just banter with the audience. In Oyamada’s Cornelius shows, what you saw in the video is what you get: just as in an animated movie, everything is meticulously sequenced and nothing is left to chance. This can arguably lend his live shows a certain robotic quality reminiscent of Kraftwerk, Devo, and YMO’s parodically robotic performances—–a style that Oyamada is clearly happy to invoke, but which can at times make his live shows feel a bit overquantized.\nBeginning with Point, then, Oyamada moves increasingly towards a multimodal conception of music as the interplay between animated sound objects within a three-dimensional space, and the visualization of this process in the animated visual objects of motion graphics. Given this interest in the correspondences between sonic and visual animation, it was perhaps inevitable that his trajectory would lead to producing soundtracks for animated movies. His soundtrack for the most recent iteration of the Ghost in the Shell series, GITS: ARISE, represents the most developed example to date of the sound-object approach. The sets of musical cues that comprise the bulk of the two CDs of the soundtracks for the ARISE series and the New Movie theatrical release are not structured in a linear way (in contrast to the linear structure of Fantasma), but instead function as modules that can be dragged and dropped onto different animated sequences as needed: most are instrumental loops whose length can be extended or shortened as required, while many are built around a simple repeating arpeggiated chord sequence.\n\n\n           \n\nMuch the same can be said of the cues used for Oyamada’s soundtrack to the NHK children’s TV show, Design Ah!—a show which is itself organized around digital animations of everyday objects, in a kind of ballet numérique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the videos that we have looked at, the relation between musical and graphic objects is metaphorical: that is, other than their synchronization and dynamic qualities, there is no necessary correspondence between them. The graphic objects themselves are not sources of the sounds we hear. Musical sounds are like splashes of paint across a moving timeline, but that is all.\nBut what if the relation between animated musical and graphical objects was more literal? Perhaps it might look something like Keita Onishi’s digital video Forest & Trees.\n\n\n\nOyamada Keigo’s collaboration with Keita Onishi in the Audio Architecture exhibition in 2018 represents another example of the increasing interchangeability of sonic and visual objects, digital music and motion graphics.\nHere as in earlier Cornelius videos, musical and graphic objects are figured as synchronized events along the moving timeline of a sequencer, but with one important difference: rather than simply observing the sequence on a two-dimensional screen, the video unfolds in a virtual space in which animated sound objects take the form of three-dimensional graphic objects; watching the video with headphones to experience its three-dimensional surround sound, it is easy to feel as if we had somehow been placed inside a virtual sequencer.\n\nThis is in fact only one of a series of such videos that experiment with three-dimensional space, immersion, and music: one features a synchronized live performance of the song by the band, with the video’s three-dimensional imagery projection-mapped onto them; the other is a projection-mapped studio performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyamada has been interested in immersive sound environments since Fantasma’s binaural stereo was optimized for headphone listening, while subsequent albums were released in 5.1 surround sound. But it is only more recently that digital video technologies have made immersive audiovisual environments a reality.\nThese are currently developing in at least three directions:\n\nFully-immersive VR environments in which the user wears a head-mounted visual display and headphones;\nInstallations, in which the audience enters a real three-dimensional space and experiences ambisonic audio and projection-mapped video;\nAugmented-reality (AR) and Mixed-reality (MR) experiences, a hybrid of the first two categories in which 3D digital objects are mapped onto real-world environments with a headset (the Magic Leap) or on the screen of a mobile phone or tablet.\n\nAt the Audio Architecture show, which emphasized large-screen projection, it became possible for the first time to walk around inside a Cornelius music video. But as far as I know, it is currently the third, AR/MR kind of immersive experience that he is currently exploring, and which seems likely to bring a new dimension to his future experiments with musical objects. Kitasenji, the design studio of his longtime collaborator Tsujikawa Koichiro, has recently been doing the same in its animated visuals for De De Mouse."

But to understand this point, we need to begin with animation."

    "text": "Animation is a key element in Oyamada’s audiovisual aesthetics. While composing his 1997 album Fantasma he visited Disneyland in Anaheim, and has said that the album was in part inspired by the “It’s A Small World” ride. Fantasma directly references Disney in several places—we could start with the similarities between Fantasma and Fantasia—but Disney is by no means the only form of animation referenced on the album: one of its most remarkable tracks is built around a sample of the theme music to a 1950s home stereo demo disk featuring the cartoon character Mr. Magoo; the same track includes a different sample of a late-1950s tune by the creator of the Chipmunks, the pitch-shifted rodents who pioneered the 1960s tape manipulation craze. Reviewers of Fantasma picked up on the album’s cartoonish quality, including its Roadrunner tempos, abrupt changes of direction, and collage aesthetics. In this respect, Fantasma has much in common with the 1930s compositions of bandleader and, later, electronic music pioneer Raymond Scott, later repurposed by Carl Stalling for Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes cartoons. In my book on Fantasma, I argue that the album in its entirety can be seen as a work of sonic animation, in which binaurally recorded sounds, from a popping soda can to a buzzing fly to cartoon soundtracks themselves, are animated in a stereophonic spectacular prefigured by Disney’s own historical landmark in surround sound, Fantasia. In many ways, I suggest, Fantasma can be seen as the musical counterpart of Tokyo Disneyland, a Japanese adaptation of the Magic Kingdom whose individual tracks are reminiscent of the spectacular vehicles of its famous Electrical Parade."

    "text": "If Fantasma’s dazzling parade of samples and musical references continually remind us that it is a small world, after all, the album proved to be a pivotal moment in Oyamada’s musical career. With his next album, Point (2000), to the disappointment of some, his music began to move in a more abstract direction, a trajectory that would continue with the album that followed it, Sensuous (2006). The transition that begins with Fantasma first involves a move away from what I call a referential music based on sampling, collage, and stylistic pastiche, which also characterized Oyamada’s first two albums as Cornelius, towards a more minimalist, non-referential music as a world of animated sound objects—a “magic kingdom” all of its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should make it clear that I’m not using either the term “non-referential” or “sound object” in Pierre Schaeffer’s sense of the term. To describe the music on Fantasma as “referential” is to say that almost its every detail, including non-musical elements, are a quotation of some sort that invites us to try to identify what it points to. The most obvious form of such reference would be the sampling of historical sound sources, or stylistic pastiche, but it also includes non-musical elements such as most of the album’s song titles (“Star Fruits Surf Rider” to “God Only Knows”), and its psychedelia-inspired artwork. Indeed, the album becomes increasingly self-referential as it progresses, reiterating earlier motifs until its penultimate track, “Thank You For The Music,” which is more or less a medley of the album itself up to that point.\nWhat we also hear on Fantasma, however, are the beginnings of a new preoccupation with sounds not heard on the preceding albums but which comes to the fore in subsequent ones, with both musical and non-musical sounds, which became the basis for a distinctive sound library utilized on many of Oyamada’s subsequent projects. These sounds are non-referential, not in Schaeffer’s sense that the source itself remains unidentifiable, but that they are not referencing a particular musical source—the way, for example, the whistled motif at the beginning of the album references the opening of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, or the melody of “2010” references Bach’s Fugue in G Minor. In Oyamada’s soundworld, we may identify a sound as coming from a musical instrument, whether a guitar, an electric piano, or an autoharp, but the loop or hit in question exists independently of any specific musical referent. From Point onwards, these sound objects, and the animated interplay between them, become the building-blocks of Oyamada’s soundworld.\nThe constant running from Fantasma to Point and beyond is animation; but whereas animation in Fantasma is primarily another kind of reference (Fantasia, Mr. Magoo), from Point onwards the emphasis shifts towards animation as a musical practice. In the albums following Fantasma, Oyamada’s music becomes increasingly modular, often recalling the drifting structure of a mobile. What is interesting about Oyamada’s interest in animation is that it is not limited to musical objects but expands into the visual realm, and the creation of animated audiovisual works that explore the interplay between music and motion graphics, sound and visual objects.\nBoth Point and Sensuous were released not just on CD as albums in the traditional sense, but also on DVD as collections which are not simply “music videos” in the PMV sense of serving a promotional purpose secondary to the songs themselves, but audiovisual works in their own right, in which the music becomes a soundtrack synchronized with animated motion graphics. Oyamada’s longstanding collaboration with visual artist Tsujikawa Koichiro is thus not just a matter of producing music videos but the co-creation of a new kind of digital visual music in which musical and graphic animation become mutually metaphorical counterparts. In one video, for example, “Like a Rolling Stone,” (a reference to Bob Dylan’s famous song), a rolling, reverberating sound object reminiscent of musique concrète finds a visual counterpart in a pebble that metaphormoses into a complex landscape of animated circling toy figures."

    "text": "Two closely related elements of this new audiovisual aesthetic are sequencing and synchronization: the seamless timing of audio and video, musical and visual sequences, so that audiovisual space and the sonic and graphic objects that animate it are experienced as one and the same thing. This synchronization of visual narrative and musical soundtrack is one of the hallmarks of animation, originating in Walt Disney’s earliest sound cartoons of the late 1920s and perfected in Fantasia, in a technique that has become known as “Mickey Mousing.” This audiovisual synchronization is today a routine practice in the studio, of course, where multi-track sequencing has made it simply a matter of dragging audio and video clips around along parallel timelines; but reproducing it in a live performance presents a much more daunting challenge. Beginning with Point and continuing with Sensuous, however, Oyamada took up this challenge, with his band performing songs in perfect synchronization with Tsujikawa’s visuals. Such synchronized performances have remained the basis of Oyamada’s live shows up to the recent tours for his latest album, Mellow Waves. While the synchronization of music and image is certainly a tour de force in terms of performance, however, it does have certain limitations, not least in its exclusion of what is arguably one of the most pleasurable elements of live musical performance: its spontaneity and capacity for the unexpected, whether in the form of extended solos, improvisations, or just banter with the audience. In Oyamada’s Cornelius shows, what you saw in the video is what you get: just as in an animated movie, everything is meticulously sequenced and nothing is left to chance. This can arguably lend his live shows a certain robotic quality reminiscent of Kraftwerk, Devo, and YMO’s parodically robotic performances—–a style that Oyamada is clearly happy to invoke, but which can at times make his live shows feel a bit overquantized.\nBeginning with Point, then, Oyamada moves increasingly towards a multimodal conception of music as the interplay between animated sound objects within a three-dimensional space, and the visualization of this process in the animated visual objects of motion graphics. Given this interest in the correspondences between sonic and visual animation, it was perhaps inevitable that his trajectory would lead to producing soundtracks for animated movies. His soundtrack for the most recent iteration of the Ghost in the Shell series, GITS: ARISE, represents the most developed example to date of the sound-object approach. The sets of musical cues that comprise the bulk of the two CDs of the soundtracks for the ARISE series and the New Movie theatrical release are not structured in a linear way (in contrast to the linear structure of Fantasma), but instead function as modules that can be dragged and dropped onto different animated sequences as needed: most are instrumental loops whose length can be extended or shortened as required, while many are built around a simple repeating arpeggiated chord sequence.\n\n\n           \n\nMuch the same can be said of the cues used for Oyamada’s soundtrack to the NHK children’s TV show, Design Ah!—a show which is itself organized around digital animations of everyday objects, in a kind of ballet numérique."

    "text": "In the videos that we have looked at, the relation between musical and graphic objects is metaphorical: that is, other than their synchronization and dynamic qualities, there is no necessary correspondence between them. The graphic objects themselves are not sources of the sounds we hear. Musical sounds are like splashes of paint across a moving timeline, but that is all.\nBut what if the relation between animated musical and graphical objects was more literal? Perhaps it might look something like Keita Onishi’s digital video Forest & Trees.\n\n\n\nOyamada Keigo’s collaboration with Keita Onishi in the Audio Architecture exhibition in 2018 represents another example of the increasing interchangeability of sonic and visual objects, digital music and motion graphics.\nHere as in earlier Cornelius videos, musical and graphic objects are figured as synchronized events along the moving timeline of a sequencer, but with one important difference: rather than simply observing the sequence on a two-dimensional screen, the video unfolds in a virtual space in which animated sound objects take the form of three-dimensional graphic objects; watching the video with headphones to experience its three-dimensional surround sound, it is easy to feel as if we had somehow been placed inside a virtual sequencer.\n\nThis is in fact only one of a series of such videos that experiment with three-dimensional space, immersion, and music: one features a synchronized live performance of the song by the band, with the video’s three-dimensional imagery projection-mapped onto them; the other is a projection-mapped studio performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyamada has been interested in immersive sound environments since Fantasma’s binaural stereo was optimized for headphone listening, while subsequent albums were released in 5.1 surround sound. But it is only more recently that digital video technologies have made immersive audiovisual environments a reality.\nThese are currently developing in at least three directions:\n\nFully-immersive VR environments in which the user wears a head-mounted visual display and headphones;\nInstallations, in which the audience enters a real three-dimensional space and experiences ambisonic audio and projection-mapped video;\nAugmented-reality (AR) and Mixed-reality (MR) experiences, a hybrid of the first two categories in which 3D digital objects are mapped onto real-world environments with a headset (the Magic Leap) or on the screen of a mobile phone or tablet.\n\nAt the Audio Architecture show, which emphasized large-screen projection, it became possible for the first time to walk around inside a Cornelius music video. But as far as I know, it is currently the third, AR/MR kind of immersive experience that he is currently exploring, and which seems likely to bring a new dimension to his future experiments with musical objects. Kitasenji, the design studio of his longtime collaborator Tsujikawa Koichiro, has recently been doing the same in its animated visuals for De De Mouse."
